# x402 Integration Plan

This document outlines a plan for integrating the x402 payment protocol into a production application.

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1-2 weeks)

1.  **Objective:** Demonstrate the core functionality of x402 in a non-production environment.
2.  **Tasks:**
    *   Set up a dedicated test server and client.
    *   Integrate the `x402-express` middleware to protect a single, non-critical API endpoint.
    *   Use the `x402-axios` client to make payments to the protected endpoint.
    *   Thoroughly test the payment flow on a testnet (e.g., `base-sepolia`).
3.  **Deliverables:**
    *   A working proof of concept demonstrating the x402 payment flow.
    *   Documentation of the setup and any challenges encountered.

## Phase 2: Production Integration (3-4 weeks)

1.  **Objective:** Integrate x402 into the production application for a limited set of users or features.
2.  **Tasks:**
    *   Identify the API endpoints to be monetized with x402.
    *   Implement robust error handling and logging for the payment flow.
    *   Set up a secure wallet for receiving payments.
    *   Deploy the x402-enabled server to production.
    *   Update the production client to support x402 payments.
3.  **Deliverables:**
    *   x402 integrated into the production application.
    *   A monitoring and alerting system for the payment flow.

## Phase 3: Full Rollout and Expansion (Ongoing)

1.  **Objective:** Roll out x402 to all users and explore new use cases.
2.  **Tasks:**
    *   Gradually roll out x402 to all users.
    *   Monitor the system for performance and reliability.
    *   Explore other x402 features, such as different payment schemes and networks.
    *   Consider contributing to the open-source x402 project.
3.  **Deliverables:**
    *   x402 fully rolled out to all users.
    *   A roadmap for future x402 development.
